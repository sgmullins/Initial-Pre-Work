// I learned that JS is a zero-based index and that you can use bracket notation to determine what character is in a specific index AnimationPlaybackEvent.

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
