// I learned that you can next arrays within other arrays and that Js either has a quirk or this module had a bug in it when it refuses to accept 00 as a value

// Example
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [["that is the answer", 100], ["but you don't know the question", 100]];
