//I learned that objects are another way to store data in a structured way. Objects are accessed and modified using properties, not indexes

// Example
var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"]
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line.
  
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Lola",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 0,
    "friends": ["People's feet!"]
    
    
    
  };
