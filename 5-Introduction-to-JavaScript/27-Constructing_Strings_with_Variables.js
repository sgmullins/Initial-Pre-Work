// I learned that you can build strings that include variables previously declared by using the + operator

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Steve";
var myStr =  "My name is " + myName +  " and I am well!" ;
