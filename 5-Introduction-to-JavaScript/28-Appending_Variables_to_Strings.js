// I learned that you can use the += operator on previously assigned variables to combine the throw.I
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "the bee's knees";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
