                <p class="info">Wolfgang G&#252;llich was a famous German rockclimber known for his groundbreaking
                    ascents, an innovative and dedicated approach to training as well as his raw finger strength.
                    G&#252;llich is most well know for his development of hard sport climbing routes in the Frankenjura,
                    a massive climbing area just north of Nuremberg Germany. Tragically, G&#252;llich died at the age of
                    32,
                    only one year after establishing the world's hardest sport climb at the time, Action Directe.

                <p class="info">In 1988, G&#252;llich pioneered the training technique of campus boarding. It was this
                    training
                    that contributed to his success on Wallstreet(8c) and Action Direct, the worlds first 9a in the
                    Frankenjura. Campus board training is now widely
                    used in the world of rock climbing training. Climbing coaches consider it to be a top exercise for
                    power recruitment.

                <p class="info">G&#252;llich shattered the boundaries of what was thought possible in the climbing world
                    at the time. From 1984-1991 he established the world's first 8b, 8b+, 8c and 9a sport climbs.
                    G&#252;llich was most
                    well known for his sport climbing, but also maintained an impressive resume of big mountain climbs
                    and free solos. Some
                    of his top climbs included:
