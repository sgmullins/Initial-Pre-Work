                <p class="info-right">Wolfgang G&#252;llich was a famous German rock climber known for his
                    groundbreaking
                    ascents, an innovative and dedicated approach to training as well as his raw finger strength.
                    G&#252;llich is most well know for his development of hard sport climbing routes in the <a
                        class="para" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106172652/frankenjura"
                        target="_blank">Frankenjura</a>,
                    a massive climbing area just north of Nuremberg Germany. At the age of 16 G&#252;llich was
                    already
                    known for his skills
                    as one of the top climbers in the region. At the age of 24 he began establishing many of the
                    worlds
                    hardest rock climbs.
                    Tragically, G&#252;llich died at the age of
                    32,
                    only one year after establishing the world's hardest sport climb at the time, Action Directe.

                <p class="info-left">In 1988, G&#252;llich pioneered the training technique of campus boarding. It was
                    this
                    training that contributed to his success on Wallstreet(8c) and Action Direct, the worlds first
                    9a in
                    the Frankenjura. Campus board training is now widely
                    used in the world of rock climbing training. Climbing coaches consider it to be a top exercise
                    for
                    power recruitment. Campus boarding is an extremely difficult exercise to perform using all of
                    your
                    finger, yet in
                    in a very famous photo, G&#252;llich is seen performing the exercise using only one finger each
                    hand, demonstrating
                    his strength and power. G&#252;llich's legacy is heavily featured in a <a class="para"

                <p class="info-right">G&#252;llich shattered the boundaries of what was thought possible in the climbing
                    world
                    at the time. From 1984-1991 he established the world's first 8b, 8b+, 8c and 9a sport climbs.
                    G&#252;llich was most
                    well known for his sport climbing, but also maintained an impressive resume of big mountain
                    climbs
                    and free solos. Some
                    of his top climbs included:
